After a two week trial, a Wisconsin jury acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse 
在经过两周的审判之后，Wisconsin陪审团裁定Kyle Rittenhouse无罪并当庭释放。

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,550
for shooting three people, killing two during a racial justice protest in Kenosha.
其曾在Kenosha的一次种族平等的抗议活动中开枪致2死1伤。

00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,520
At the time Rittenhouse was a 17 year old from Illinois
案发时，Rittenhouse是一名来自伊利诺伊的17岁少年。

00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,120
who traveled to Kenosha after right-wing
在右翼社交媒体的号召下，Rittenhouse来到

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,580
social media accounts called on people
Kenosha市，

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,347
to protect the city from riots.
以保护这座城市免受暴徒的破坏。

>- I am an EMT, if you
are injured come to me.

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,890
>- Rittenhouse acted in the
midst of a chaotic protest

10
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,480
>where many people were
legally carrying guns.

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,220
>Bystander video showed that the three men

12
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,700
>that Rittenhouse shot had been
in confrontations with him.

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,700
>Rittenhouse has now been found
not guilty on all six counts,

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,580
>arising from his conduct that day.

15
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,175
>- [Jury Member] We the
jury, find the defendant

16
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:37,820
>Kyle H. Rittenhouse not guilty.

17
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,960
>- So what happened at
the Rittenhouse trial?

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,310
>Why did the jury conclude
that he was not guilty?

19
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,457
>Is it a travesty of justice
or a defensible outcome?

20
00:00:45,457 --> 00:00:48,090
>(light music)

21
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,010
>There's no dispute that
Rittenhouse killed two men

22
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,210
>and injured a third, but
as we talk about often

23
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,970
>on this channel, that's not
the end of the analysis.

24
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,190
>And here it was only the beginning.

25
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,050
>Many people thought that
when Kyle Rittenhouse

26
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,160
>admitted on the stand that he
intentionally use deadly force

27
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,140
>on Rosenbaum and Huber, that
was a huge tactical blunder.

28
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,960
>But intentional use of deadly force

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,520
>is exactly the thing that is privileged

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,040
>when you meet the
requirements of self-defense.

31
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,370
>And this case hinged on whether
self-defense applied or not.

32
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,706
>And more so than most self-defense cases,

33
00:01:15,706 --> 00:01:17,720
>this case turned on the nuances

34
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,310
>of both self-defense law
and criminal procedure.

35
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,920
>It's not surprising to me that both sides

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,720
>got lots of stuff legally wrong.

37
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,280
>So let's talk about the law
of self-defense in Wisconsin,

38
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,058
>because every state has
different self-defense laws.

39
00:01:29,058 --> 00:01:32,040
>And in Wisconsin, self-defense
like many other states,

40
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,100
>is an affirmative defense.

41
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,090
>In other words, the
defendant has the burden

42
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,500
>of producing some evidence.

43
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,020
>They must put forth some evidence

44
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,220
>from which a jury can find
that self-defense applied.

45
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,660
>This is generally called
the burden of production.

46
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,980
>But then, once the defense has made

47
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,410
>this relatively minimal burden,

48
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,790
>the burden of proof then
returns to the prosecution,

49
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,320
>which must disprove self-defense
beyond a reasonable doubt,

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,810
>which is the highest
standard in all of law.

51
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,810
>Now, every state has a self-defense law

52
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,990
>that basically says a person
who is not the aggressor

53
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,440
>is justified in using deadly force

54
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,380
>against an adversary when he
or she reasonably believes

55
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,990
>that they're in imminent danger

56
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,910
>of death or serious bodily injury.

57
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,720
>Now jurors aren't lawyers.

58
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,410
>So juries receive jury
instructions that include

59
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,550
>all the law that they will
need to decide a case,

60
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,050
>hopefully written in plain English.

61
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,620
>The lawyers and the judge fight
over the jury instructions,

62
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,580
>which will be the only law
that the jurors receive

63
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,840
>in that particular case.

64
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,970
>Now it is supposed to accurately summarize

65
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,120
>the law that the jurors are applying.

66
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,980
>And as you can imagine,

67
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,680
>the language of the jury instructions

68
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,060
>is extremely important.

69
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,570
>The Rittenhouse jury instructions

70
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,487
>summarize the requirements for
self-defense in Wisconsin as

71
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,220
>"the defendant believed
that there was an actual

72
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,800
>or imminent unlawful interference

73
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,160
>with the defendant's person.

74
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,380
>And the defendant believed
that the amount of force

75
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,360
>the defendant used or threatened to use

76
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,300
>was necessary to prevent or
terminate the interference

77
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,150
>and the defendant's
beliefs were reasonable.

78
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,930
>The defendant may intentionally use force,

79
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,950
>which is intended or likely to cause death

80
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,460
>or great bodily harm only if the defendant

81
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,890
>reasonably believed that
the force used was necessary

82
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,280
>to prevent death or great
bodily harm to himself."

83
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,130
>Now, in a situation like this,

84
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,510
>a reasonable belief doesn't mean true.

85
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,680
>One can have a reasonable
belief, but still be mistaken.

86
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,770
>Reasonableness is determined
from the standpoint

87
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,810
>of the defendant in
the situation at issue,

88
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,230
>not after the fact.

89
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,180
>And as an aside, the law of self-defense

90
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,130
>gets slightly more complicated
when you're applying it

91
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,100
>to different varieties of
homicide and manslaughter,

92
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,420
>because the mental state required

93
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,200
>is different for each of those offenses.

94
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
>But you can read the jury
instructions themselves

95
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,470
>and see how the court
modified the general rules

96
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,440
>that apply to self-defense
to apply to each

97
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,030
>of the different charges in this case.

98
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,950
>It's all written down in
relatively plain English,

99
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,100
>and it's worthwhile.

100
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,580
>You might be on a jury someday,

101
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,420
>and you might be faced with
similar jury instructions.

102
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,620
>Now, Wisconsin doesn't have
what's called a duty to retreat.

103
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,820
>In other words, Wisconsin
law doesn't require someone

104
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,129
>whose life is in danger to
exercise all opportunities

105
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:49,470
>to flee before resorting to deadly force.

106
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,474
>But, jurors can consider whether someone

107
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:53,320
>tried to move away from danger,

108
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,320
>as they assess the reasonableness
of a self-defense claim.

109
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,700
>Juries are still allowed to consider

110
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,670
>whether the defendant had
an opportunity to retreat

111
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,450
>to determine whether
or not it was necessary

112
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,370
>to use deadly force in self-defense.

113
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,740
>And Wisconsin law doesn't quite go as far

114
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,300
>as stand your ground states,

115
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,360
>which remove any consideration
of deescalating or fleeing

116
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,000
>before resorting to deadly force.

117
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,160
>However, as we'll talk about later,

120
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,560
>Now at common law, a
majority of jurisdictions

121
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,840

122

when the attack which ensues

157
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,530
>is of a type causing the person engaging

158
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,090
>in the unlawful conduct
to reasonably believe

159
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,670
>that he or she is an imminent danger

160
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,480
>of death or great bodily harm."

161
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,440
>Okay, so let's break down
this law on provocation,

162
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,650
>which is an exception to the
exception of self-defense,

163
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,440
>which is an exception to the ability

164
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,770
>to use deadly force against someone.

165
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,970
>So let's say you engage
in unlawful conduct

166
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,750
>likely to provoke others.

167
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,730
>Well, then you can't claim self-defense.

168
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,100
>Except that you can, if your
provocation causes others

169
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,780
>to use effectively
deadly force against you.

170
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,100
>Now we'll get back to this in a second,

171
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,240
>but the law continues.

172
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,090
>In such a case where the provoked attacker

173
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,170
>uses deadly force against the provoker,

174
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,560
>the person engaging in
the unlawful conduct

175
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,660
>is privileged to act in self-defense,

176
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,700
>but the person is not privileged

177
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,210
>to resort to the use of force

178
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,190
>intended or likely to cause
death to the person's assailant.

179
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,650
>Unless the person reasonably
believes that he or she

180
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,700
>has exhausted every other reasonable means

181
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,630
>to escape from or otherwise
avoid death or great bodily harm

182
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,640
>at the hands of his or her assailant.

183
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,610
>So here, you only get to use deadly force

184
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,320
>to resist the deadly
force that you provoked

185
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,320
>if you exercise a duty to retreat.

186
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,780
>Wisconsin law stipulates
that the provocateur

187
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,700
>must attempt every other
reasonable option to escape,

188
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,360
>avoid, or prevent the attack

189
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,570
>before resorting to deadly
force if they were the ones

190
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,010
>that provoked the secondary attack.

191
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,210
>Now we'll talk about the
general law of self-defense

192
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,770
>and whether it applies under
the factual circumstances

193
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,610
>as we know them in a second.

194
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,430
>But first I want to talk about
the exception of provocation

195
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,220
>because a number of people believe

196
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,350
>that Kyle Rittenhouse provoked
the attacks themselves,

197
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,280
>and therefore couldn't use
the privilege of self-defense.

198
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,440
>That by brandishing a firearm

199
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,860
>or placing himself in this situation,

200
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,010
>he provoked the attack.

201
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,430
>Now there's three issues here.

202
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,850
>First, is there unlawful conduct?

203
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,570
>Did Kyle Rittenhouse
engage in unlawful conduct

204
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,970
>that could constitute provocation

205
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,360
>and therefore prevent the
defense of self-defense?

206
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,740
>Well, Judge Schroeder granted
defense motions to dismiss

207
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,990
>the two misdemeanor charges
against Rittenhouse.

208
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,900
>I think a lot of people
put too much emphasis

209
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,090
>on those lesser included offenses.

210
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,550
>The charges were for possessing

211
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,050
>a dangerous weapon as a minor,

212
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,150
>and a misdemeanor charge
for breaking curfew.

213
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,790
>And arguably, Wisconsin
law has an exception

214
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,670
>that allows miners to
possess shotguns and rifles,

215
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,160
>as long as they're not short barreled.

216
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,690
>But more importantly, provocation requires

217
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,420
>unlawful conduct of a type
likely to provoke others.

218
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,650
>Now, even if those two lesser
included charges had stuck,

219
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,790
>they might not have been sufficient

220
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,900
>to rise to the level of provocation.

221
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,460
>Mainly because Wisconsin
is an open carry state.

222
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,450
>Mere open carry of a
firearm is A, not unlawful.

223
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,160
>And B, possibly not the type

224
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,160
>likely to lead to provoking others.

225
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,730
>Now I'm oversimplifying here.

226
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,630
>This is a highly fact-specific analysis,

227
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,280
>but it's not unreasonable
that someone might not find

228
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,870
>that the gun possession,
quad gun possession

229
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,500
>didn't lead to provocation.

230
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,700
>Think about it, is it
the possession of the gun

231
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,000
>that provokes the attack?

232
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,640
>Or is it the possession
of a gun by a minor

233
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,740
>or possession of a gun
that crossed state lines

234
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,470
>that leads to someone provoking an attack?

235
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,040
>If you think it's the former,
well, that's not illegal.

236
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,500
>And the latter probably
doesn't provoke an attack.

237
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,150
>No one says, oh, the
reason I'm attacking you

238
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,880
>is that you're a minor with a firearm,

239
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,870
>not that you're carrying a
firearm in the first place.

240
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,720
>And additionally, breaking curfew

241
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,790
>probably couldn't be
the requisite predicate

242
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,910
>because lots of people
were breaking curfew

243
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,660
>and it wasn't leading to mass provocation.

244
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,730
>Now, it's a closer call when
you consider Rittenhouse

245
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,820
>admitted that he pointed
his gun at the victims

246
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,880
>and claimed that when
he was pointing his gun,

247
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,770
>it wasn't a dangerous provocation.

248
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,900
>Now you could argue that
pointing your gun at someone

249
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,050
>is assault or misuse of a firearm,

250
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,450
>but that probably doesn't work

251
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,180
>if the reason that you're pointing the gun

252
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,340
>at someone in the first place

253
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,930
>is for the purposes of self-defense.

254
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,350
>And in fact, there are
Wisconsin cases to this effect.

255
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,440
>Though, on the other other hand,

256
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,060
>Wisconsin courts have
an interesting history

257
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,850
>in analyzing the provocation exception.

258
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,050
>For example, in a 1975
Wisconsin Supreme Court case,

259
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,020
>the court held that the
defendant was a provocateur

260
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,780
>by virtue of openly bringing
a gun into a tavern.

261
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,497
>The Wisconsin Supreme Court held quote,

262
00:09:35,497 --> 00:09:37,770
>"the defendant himself testified
that after being slapped,

263
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,590
>he went out to his car, got his shotgun,

264
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,460
>loaded it and returned to the tavern.

>As he was entering the tavern,

266
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,930
>he was grabbed from the side by someone

267
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,690
>and he pushed that person away.

268
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,140
>He saw Freddy Jones start toward him

269
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,090
>and he started shooting.

00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,270
>He stopped after four shots

271
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,450
>and after Jones was out of sight.

272

>The defendant requests that the court

273
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,730
>grant him a new trial in
the interest of justice.

274

>We find no merit to this contention.

him to prevent the shooting

Rittenhouse shooting.

286
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,180

testimony seems to indicate

287

>that Rosenbaum didn't lunge at Rittenhouse

288

>until he raised his gun at Rosenbaum.

289

least one of the reasons

290
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,450
>that Kyle Rittenhouse shot
Rosenbaum is that he feared

>that Rosenbaum would take his gun away

292

>And we'll talk about that in a second.

294
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,540
>And obviously, you'd have to
run a provocation analysis

295
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,900
>in every instance where Kyle
Rittenhouse used deadly force.

297

>You have to look at every
instance individually.

298

>And if the jury had found that there was

299

>nothing unlawful that led to provocation,

300
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,800
>or if there were illegal things going on,

301

were leading to the provocation,

>their analysis to this exception

303
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,850
>probably would have ended there.

304
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,180

that provocation didn't apply.

first hurdle had been met,

those two first hurdles,

322

get over the third hurdle,

324

>assuming the first two hurdles are met.

327

328

cannot use or threaten force,

329

334

issues might have precluded

335

336

337

dry is definitely wrong.

the original exception,

348

could reasonably have applied

>that one or more of these incidents

428
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,240

were therefore murder.

429

430

threw a bag of clothes

land anywhere near Rittenhouse.

points his gun at him.

four times, once in the back.

reasonable minds can differ.

>It's not surprising that the
people who pursued Rittenhouse

445

who needed to be stopped.

446
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,980
>But the only question
in this particular case

447
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,480
>was whether Rittenhouse's actions

448

>Because remember, the standard is that

450
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,310

there is no reasonable doubts

451

and the people he killed

454

459
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,090

belief was reasonable

460

came to the scene,

468

469
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,370
>and disarmed the perpetrator.

470
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,370
>Zamudio later said that in his confusion,

471

>he was within seconds of shooting

472
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,600
>one of the people that was
helping, not the shooter himself.

473

>This is an issue that
champions of Rittenhouse

474
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:46,980

>If Rosenbalm or Huber or Grosskreutz

might differ on this.

claim of self-defense.

483

486

488

>Anyone that brings it,
not just Kyle Rittenhouse.

490
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,680
>But there's a large strain
of people that simply say

491
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,270
>that Kyle Rittenhouse
shouldn't have been there.

492
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,090
>And that's the reason that
he can't use self-defense.

493
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,990
>And by most accounts,

494
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,600
>Kyle Rittenhouse meets the
definition of a vigilante.

495
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,920
>But whether Kyle Rittenhouse
should have been there

496
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,420

relevant to the questions

497
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,640
>of whether he legally met the definition

498

>Just simply possessing a gun by itself,

500
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,110

application of self-defense.

501
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,900
>And there are of course, larger
social issues here as well.

502
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,820
>Many have claimed that it
would have been impossible

503

>for a black person to kill two people,

504

the scene as Rittenhouse did.

506
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,430
>And then of course, to
be found, not guilty.

507
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,520
>And we can probably evaluate
whether this is true or not.

508
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,210
>One way to look at this
is by studying the data

509
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,670
>on how jury's perceive self-defense.

510
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,560
>a study by John Roman found that homicides

511
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,460
>with a white perpetrator
and a black victim

512
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,160
>are 10 times more likely
to be ruled justified

513
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,700
>than cases with a black
perpetrator and a white victim.

514
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,520
>And the gap is larger in states
with stand your ground laws.

515
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,940
>And after accounting for a
variety of confounding factors,

516
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,130
>such as whether the victim and
perpetrator were strangers,

517
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,920
>the gap is smaller, but still significant.

518
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,150
>Cases with a white
perpetrator and black victim

519
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,140
>are 281% more likely to be ruled justified

520

>than cases with a black
perpetrator and white victim.

521
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,310
>But systemic issues like
that weren't on trial here.

522
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,490
>You don't adjudicate those
kinds of systemic issues

523
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,450
>in a criminal court of one individual.

524
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,000
>The issue is whether Kyle Rittenhouse

525
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,290
>engaged in self-defense
or more specifically,

526
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,860
>whether the prosecution
disproved the possibility

527
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,080
>that he used self-defense.

528
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,520
>And for what it's worth,
there are lots of people

529
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,090
>who think that Kyle Rittenhouse's actions

530
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,410
>were not self-defense.

531
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,710
>There are lots of other reasonable people

532
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,310

actions were self-defense.

533
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,440

536

>like the Kenosha jury did.

537
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,910
>But the thing is, if reasonable people

538
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,220
>really could conclude that
this was self-defense,

539
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,420
>then it means that the prosecution

540
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,429
>didn't prove self-defense
beyond a reasonable doubt.

541
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:22,300
>That's the definition of reasonable doubt.

542
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,250
>Now that being said, an
acquittal doesn't mean

543
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,070
>that Kyle Rittenhouse didn't do it.

544
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,110
>It doesn't mean that what Kyle
Rittenhouse did was right.

545
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,614
>And the pathology of Kyle Rittenhouse's

546
00:19:31,614 --> 00:19:33,620
>hagiography is another issue entirely.

547
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,460
>And it certainly doesn't mean
that he did nothing wrong.

548
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,403
>It just means the jury didn't think

549
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:39,250
>that the prosecution proved self-defense

550
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,310
>beyond a reasonable doubt.

551
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,940
>And while you can't necessarily infer it

552
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,040

it might be the case

553
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,570
>that Kyle Rittenhouse did
nothing legally wrong.

554

>But under the most favorable
interpretations of the facts,

555
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,980

gasoline to a match party

556

>and people are now dead as a result.

557

someone uses non-deadly force

>against you while you are carrying a gun,

560
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,730

>Rosenbaum, jump-kick
man and arguably, Huber,

562

563

belief of imminent harm.

565

>Which is not to say that unarmed people

566

>of eminent, deadly harm,
they absolutely can.

568

>Indeed, it appears that the jury

569
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,550

570

>that they were going for his gun

571
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,940
>or grabbed his gun in an
attempt to take his gun

572

>and use it against him.

573
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,630

Rittenhouse's speculation,

version is that the jury

00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,330
>is not guilty, by reason of self-defense,

621
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,640
>Gaige Grosskreutz would
also have been not guilty

622
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,490
>if he had shot and
killed Kyle Rittenhouse.

623
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,820
>And keep in mind that in this scenario,

624
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,334
>Kyle Rittenhouse is dead
and it would have been

625
00:22:13,334 --> 00:22:15,310
>Grosskreutz setting the narrative.

626
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,120
>And to the extent that
you think Grosskreutz

627
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,190
>would have crafted his
testimony to support

628
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,630
>an argument of self-defense,

629
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,880
>then consider that Kyle
Rittenhouse probably crafted

630
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,730
>his story in exactly the same way.

631
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,130
>So the ultimate takeaway here

632
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,620
>is that these incidents are murky at best.

633
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,640
>Occurred in a jurisdiction with very broad

634
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,700
>self-defense and firearm laws.

635
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,130
>The prosecution had a very
high standard to meet.

636
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,860
>And while we didn't
cover it in this video,

637
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,930
>the defendant put on a very good defense.

638
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,980
>The rest I will leave to you.

639
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,720
>Now, if you'd like to
watch something legal,

640
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,150
>that's much more lighthearted,

641
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,600
>I'd recommend my mini
documentary, "Bad Law Words Good"

642
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,700
>where I explore all of
the most common legal

643
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,480
>and linguistic comments
that people throw around

644
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,430
>in everyday life incorrectly.

645
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,260
>It is a hilarious and educational romp

646
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,480
>through legal misunderstandings,
logical fallacies,

647
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,260
>and law and order parodies.

648
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,310
>And it's only on Nebula,
which you can get for free

649
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,730
>with Curiosity Stream.

650
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,370
>Because Nebula is where I
release all my videos early,

651
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,830
>usually with extended cuts
and where I can experiment

652
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,320
>with content and put things
that I couldn't put on YouTube.

653
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,160
>And we're thrilled to be
partnering with today's sponsor

654
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,980
>Curiosity Stream, because
they're the go-to source

655
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,980
>for the best documentaries

656
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,350
>and long form educational
content on the internet.

657
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,530
>They even have an entire section

658
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,390

659
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,480
>So if you like my videos,

660
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,270

00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,040

664
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,140
