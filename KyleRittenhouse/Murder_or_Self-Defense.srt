在经过两周的审判之后，Wisconsin陪审团裁定Kyle Rittenhouse无罪并当庭释放。

for shooting three people, killing two during a racial justice protest in Kenosha.
其曾在Kenosha的一次种族平等的抗议活动中开枪致2死1伤。


4
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:10,520
At the time Rittenhouse was a 17 year old from Illinois
案发时，Rittenhouse是一名来自伊利诺伊的17岁少年。

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,120
who traveled to Kenosha after right-wing
在右翼社交媒体的号召下，

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,580
social media accounts called on people

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,347
to protect the city from riots.

8
00:00:15,347 --> 00:00:18,350
I am an EMT, if you are injured come to me.
我是名急救人员，如果你受伤了就到我这儿来。

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:20,890
Rittenhouse acted in the midst of a chaotic protest
Rittenhouse在这场骚乱中跑前跑后，其中参与者

10
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,480
where many people were legally carrying guns.
不乏众多合法持枪人员。

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,220
Bystander video showed that the three men
旁观者拍摄的视频显示被Rittenhouse用枪

12
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,700
that Rittenhouse shot had been in confrontations with him.
击中的三个人曾与其发生过对峙。

13
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,700
Rittenhouse has now been found not guilty on all six counts,
因其当天的行为，Rittenhouse 一共被指控了6项罪名，

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,580
arising from his conduct that day.
而今，这6项指控均被裁定无效，（并被当庭释放）。

15
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,175
[Jury Member] We the jury, find the defendant
[陪审团人员] 我们陪审团，认定被告人

00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:37,820
Kyle H. Rittenhouse not guilty.

17
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,960
So what happened at the Rittenhouse trial?
那么，在这场对Rittenhouse的审判中，到底发生了什么呢？

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,310
Why did the jury conclude that he was not guilty?
为什么陪审团最终给出他无罪的结论呢？

19
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,457
Is it a travesty of justice or a defensible outcome?
这是对正义的歪曲吗？或者这是一个可辩护的结果？

20
00:00:45,457 --> 00:00:48,090
(light music)
（轻音乐）

21
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,010
There's no dispute that Rittenhouse killed two men
有一点是无争议的，那就是Rittenhouse枪杀2人

22
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,210
and injured a third, but as we talk about often
伤1人，但是正如我们频道经常说的那样，

23
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,970
on this channel, that's not the end of the analysis.
这不是对案件分析的结尾，

24
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,190
And here it was only the beginning.
恰恰是开始分析的地方。

25
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,050
Many people thought that when Kyle Rittenhouse
许多人认为，当Kyle Rittenhouse

26
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,160
admitted on the stand that he intentionally use deadly force
在法庭上承认他有意使用了致命武器

27
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,140
on Rosenbaum and Huber, that was a huge tactical blunder.
来对付Rosenbaum和Huber，是一种策略上的重大失误。

28
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,960
But intentional use of deadly force
但是，有意使用致命武器

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,520
is exactly the thing that is privileged
恰好是此类案件能够

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,040
when you meet the requirements of self-defense.
以正当防卫进行辩护的必要条件。

31
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,370
And this case hinged on whether self-defense applied or not.
因此，这起案件关键点是：正当防卫是否适用。

32
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,706
And more so than most self-defense cases,
而相比于大多数的自卫案件，(本案)更是如此。

33
00:01:15,706 --> 00:01:17,720
this case turned on the nuances
本案揭示了自卫法与

34
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,310
of both self-defense law and criminal procedure.
刑事诉讼程序之间的细微差别。

35
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,920
It's not surprising to me that both sides
我并不惊讶于当事双方

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,720
got lots of stuff legally wrong.
都有很多不合法的行为存在。

37
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,280
So let's talk about the law of self-defense in Wisconsin,
那我们先来看一下Wisconsin州关于自卫的法律规定，

38
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,058
because every state has different self-defense laws.
因为每个州的自卫法律都有些差别。

39
00:01:29,058 --> 00:01:32,040
And in Wisconsin, self-defense like many other states,
不过Wisconsin关于自卫的规定与其他许多州相同，

40
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,100
is an affirmative defense.
(在法庭上)是一种积极性抗辩。

41
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,090
In other words, the defendant has the burden
也就是说，辩护方承担

42
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,500
of producing some evidence.
提交证据的责任。

43
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,020
They must put forth some evidence
他们必须提交一些证据以使

44
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,220
from which a jury can find that self-defense applied.
陪审团认为自卫的条件适用于本案。

45
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,660
This is generally called the burden of production.
通常来说，这被称为举证责任。

46
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,980
But then, once the defense has made
届时，一旦辩方履行了

47
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,410
this relatively minimal burden,
这种相对较小的责任之后，

48
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,790
the burden of proof then returns to the prosecution,
证明责任的重担就落到了控方这里，

49
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,320
which must disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt,
控方必须无可置疑的推翻自卫适用的结论，

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,810
which is the highest standard in all of law.
这在所有的法律案件中是最高水平的标准。

51
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,810
Now, every state has a self-defense law
现在，每个州都有自己的自卫法规，

52
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,990
that basically says a person who is not the aggressor
基本上都是说：若一个人不是冲突挑衅者，

53
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,440
is justified in using deadly force
在面对对方的攻击时，如果他合理的认为

54
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,380
against an adversary when he or she reasonably believes
他的生命和身体健康

55
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,990
that they're in imminent danger
即将处于危险中时，

56
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,910
of death or serious bodily injury.
他有权利使用致命武器进行防卫。

57
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,720
Now jurors aren't lawyers.
由于陪审员不是律师，

58
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,410
So juries receive jury instructions that include
因此，陪审团会收到所有判案时

59
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,550
all the law that they will need to decide a case,
需要参照的法律指引，

60
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,050
hopefully written in plain English.
希望这些指引是用白话文写的（与专业词汇描述相比）。

61
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,620
The lawyers and the judge fight over the jury instructions,
律师和法官就这些指引进行辩论，

62
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,580
which will be the only law that the jurors receive
对于陪审团而言，这些法律指引是他们

63
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,840
in that particular case.
判案的唯一依据。

64
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,970
Now it is supposed to accurately summarize
我们可以认为陪审团用到的

65
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,120
the law that the jurors are applying.
法律指引被准确的加以概括总结。

66
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,980
And as you can imagine,
自然地，你也能想象到

67
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,680
the language of the jury instructions
这些陪审团指引在语言上如何描述

68
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,060
is extremely important.
是非常重要的。

69
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,570
The Rittenhouse jury instructions
Rittenhouse案陪审团使用的法律指引

70
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,487
summarize the requirements for self-defense in Wisconsin as
将Wisconsin州法律中正当防卫的条件总结为：

71
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,220
"the defendant believed that there was an actual
“1）被告坚信自己即将遭受实际的

72
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,160
or imminent unlawful interference with the defendant's person.
非法的侵害；

73
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,380
And the defendant believed that the amount of force
2）并且为了防止或者终止这种侵害，

74
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,360
the defendant used or threatened to use
被告认为有必要使用或威胁使用

75
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,300
was necessary to prevent or terminate the interference
一定程度的暴力；

76
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,150
and the defendant's beliefs were reasonable.
3）并且被告在当时情形下的认知是合理的。

77
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,930
The defendant may intentionally use force,
被告可以有意的使用那些

78
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,950
which is intended or likely to cause death
可能造成他人死亡或重大人身伤害

79
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,460
or great bodily harm only if the defendant
的武器，（前提是）只要被告

80
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,890
reasonably believed that the force used was necessary
合理的认为必须采取这样的暴力行为

81
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,280
to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself."
才能防止自身的死亡或重大伤害。”

82
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,130
Now, in a situation like this,
现在我想说，在这样的情况下，

83
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,510
a reasonable belief doesn't mean true.
一种合理的认知并不意味着是正确的。

84
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,680
One can have a reasonable belief, but still be mistaken.
你可以有个合理的看法，但依然是错的。

85
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,770
Reasonableness is determined from the standpoint
合理性是由被告

86
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,810
of the defendant in the situation at issue,
当时的立场决定的，

87
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,230
not after the fact.
而不是事后诸葛。

88
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,180
And as an aside, the law of self-defense
顺便说一句，自卫法

89
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,130
gets slightly more complicated when you're applying it
对于各种蓄意谋杀和过失杀人案件的

90
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,100
to different varieties of homicide and manslaughter,
适用规定会更复杂些，

91
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,420
because the mental state required
因为对于每种案件，其要求

92
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,200
is different for each of those offenses.
的精神状态有所不同。

93
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
But you can read the jury instructions themselves
但是，你可以阅读一下陪审团指引

94
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,470
and see how the court modified the general rules
看看法庭是如何将自卫法的一般性规定

95
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,440
that apply to self-defense to apply to each
进行修改，以适用于本案中

96
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,030
of the different charges in this case.
不同的罪名指控。

97
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,950
It's all written down in relatively plain English,
这些都是用相对易懂的白话文写的，

98
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:34,100
and it's worthwhile.
并且值得你看看，

99
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,580
You might be on a jury someday,
因为你某天可能成为一名陪审员，

100
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,420
and you might be faced with similar jury instructions.
到时你也会收到类似的法律指引。

101
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,620
Now, Wisconsin doesn't have what's called a duty to retreat.
当前，Wisconsin并不要求逃跑义务，

102
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,820
In other words, Wisconsin law doesn't require someone
换句话说，Wisconsin州的法律并不要求：受害者

103
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,129
whose life is in danger to exercise all opportunities
面临生命危险时必须要先采取各种途径尝试逃离，

104
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:49,470
to flee before resorting to deadly force.
否则不能使用致命武器进行自卫反击。


105
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,474
But, jurors can consider whether someone
但是，陪审人员可以将受害者是否

106
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:53,320
tried to move away from danger,
尝试过逃离现场这一点

107
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,320
as they assess the reasonableness of a self-defense claim.
来作为评估正当防卫成立的合理性。

108
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,700
Juries are still allowed to consider
陪审团也可以考虑

109
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,670
whether the defendant had an opportunity to retreat
被告是否有机会逃离现场

110
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,450
to determine whether or not it was necessary
来决定其是否有必要

111
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,370
to use deadly force in self-defense.
使用致命武器进行自卫反击。

112
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,740
And Wisconsin law doesn't quite go as far
当然，Wisconsin州的法律也并没有

113
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,300
as stand your ground states,
极端到毫不退让的程度，

114
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,360
which remove any consideration of deescalating or fleeing
这样的规定允许受害者在使用致命武器反击之前

115
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,000
before resorting to deadly force.
无需考虑任何的妥协或逃离。

116
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,160
However, as we'll talk about later,
然而，正如我们稍后要讨论的，

117
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,990
Wisconsin does have a duty to retreat
Wisconsin州确实有一种情况要求逃跑义务：

118
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,410
where the person provokes the attack against them.
当冲突挑衅者自己（反过来）受到了威胁。

119
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,560
Now at common law, a majority of jurisdictions
在普通法中，多数州的法律法规

120
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,840
require a duty to retreat before being allowed to engage
要求在使用致命武器之前

121
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,990
in deadly force in self-defense.
必须要先履行逃跑义务。

122
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,910
But today, a duty to retreat is required
但是现在，只有少数州的法律

123
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,640
in only a minority of US states.
要求这一逃跑义务。

124
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,810
Here is a duty to retreat instruction from Massachusetts.
Massachusetts州关于逃跑义务的规定如下：

125
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,791
Quote, "a person cannot lawfully act in self-defense
“一个人在穷尽完所有合理的逃生途径之前

126
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,073
unless he or she has exhausted
不能诉诸于暴力（对挑衅者）

127
00:04:36,073 --> 00:04:39,740
all other reasonable alternatives before resorting to force.
进行自卫反击。

128
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,010
A person may use physical force in self-defense
一个人只有在他或她在当时

130
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,150
only if he or she could not get out of the situation
无法通过任何有效且合理的途径逃离现场时

131
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,020
in some other way that was available
才可以使用物理的力量

132
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,480
and reasonable at the time.
进行自卫反击。

133
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,157
The Commonwealth, that is the state of Massachusetts,
Massachusetts州（检方）

134
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:52,175
may prove the defendant did not act in self-defense
需无可置疑的证明

135
00:04:52,175 --> 00:04:54,320
by proving beyond a reasonable doubt
被告在诉诸暴力之前

136
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,010
that the defendant resorted to force
没有使用合理有效

137
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,550
without using avenues of escape
且不会置其于更危险境地的逃生途径，

138
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,320
that were reasonably available and which could not
从而使正当防卫的

139
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,900
have exposed the defendant to further danger."
辩护不成立。”

140
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,550
Again, that's the law of Massachusetts
再声明一次，那是Massachusetts州的法律，

141
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,550
and it's not the law of Wisconsin.
不是Wisconsin州的。

142
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,290
And it should go without saying that the Kenosha jury
并且无需多说，Kenosha陪审团

143
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,230
was applying the law of Wisconsin at the time.
肯定依据的是Wisconsin州的法律。

144
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,600
And we'll talk about the implications
接下来，我们就讨论一下

145
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,220
of this particular aspect of Wisconsin law in a second.
Wisconsin州法律中这种特殊情况的含义。

146
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,120
But the final nuance of self-defense at issue
在正当防卫的争论中，最终的差别点

147
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,380
is that of provocation.
在于（被告是否进行了）挑衅。

148
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,800
A person who provokes an attack
冲突的挑衅者

149
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,461
cannot claim legal self-defense.
不能声称自己是正当防卫，

150
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:25,480
But it's more complicated than just that.
当然实际情况更复杂些。

151
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,607
The Wisconsin law on provocation states,
Wisconsin州法对于挑衅方规定：

152
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:29,790
"a person who engages in unlawful conduct
“一个人因其某种非法行为

153
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,880
of a type likely to provoke others to attack him or her,
可能诱使他人对其进行反击，

154
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,310
and thereby does provoke an attack
并且（在非法行为后）确实引发了他人的反击，

155
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,490
is not entitled to claim the privilege of self-defense
（那么，）这个人对此类反击无权声称

156
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,560
against such attack, except when the attack which ensues
正当防卫，除非这样的反击

157
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,530
is of a type causing the person engaging
使得非法行为人

158
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,090
in the unlawful conduct to reasonably believe
合理的认为

159
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,670
that he or she is an imminent danger
他或她即将遭受死亡的威胁

160
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,480
of death or great bodily harm."
或重大人身伤害（才可进行正当防卫）。”

161
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,440
Okay, so let's break down this law on provocation,
OK，我们来拆解一下法律中关于挑衅的规定：

162
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,650
which is an exception to the exception of self-defense,
如果正当防卫算作一种允许使用致命武器对付他人的例外，

163
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,440
which is an exception to the ability
那么允许挑衅者使用正当防卫

164
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,770
to use deadly force against someone.
就是一种例外中的例外。

165
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,970
So let's say you engage in unlawful conduct
所以我们说当你进行某种非法行为

166
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,750
likely to provoke others,
而可能导致他人反击时，

167
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,730
well, then you can't claim self-defense.
你无权声称正当防卫。

168
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,100
Except that you can, if your provocation causes others
但如果你的挑衅行为致使对方使用

169
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,780
to use effectively deadly force against you.
有效的致命武器对付你时，你就可以。

170
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,100
Now we'll get back to this in a second,
稍后我们还会说回这一点，

171
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,240
but the law continues.
法律继续说到，

172
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,090
In such a case where the provoked attacker
在反击者使用致命武器

173
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,170
uses deadly force against the provoker,
对付挑衅者的情况下，

174
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,560
the person engaging in the unlawful conduct
非法行为人（即挑衅者）

175
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,660
is privileged to act in self-defense,
有权进行正当防卫，

176
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,700
but the person is not privileged
但是挑衅者无权

177
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,210
to resort to the use of force
使用可能造成反击者死亡

178
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,190
intended or likely to cause death to the person's assailant,
的暴力武器（进行自卫），

179
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,650
unless the person reasonably believes that he or she
除非挑衅者合理的认为他或她

180
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,700
has exhausted every other reasonable means
已经穷尽了所有的逃离途径，以及尝试了

181
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,630
to escape from or otherwise avoid death or great bodily harm
各种避免生命死亡

182
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,640
at the hands of his or her assailant.
或重大人身伤害的方式。

183
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,610
So here, you only get to use deadly force
所以此种情况下，你能使用致命武器

184
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,320
to resist the deadly force that you provoked
对抗你挑起的威胁的唯一

185
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,320
if you exercise a duty to retreat.
条件是你履行了逃跑义务。

186
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,780
Wisconsin law stipulates that the provocateur
Wisconsin州的法律规定，冲突挑衅者

187
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,700
must attempt every other reasonable option to escape,
必须在尝试了各种逃离，

188
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,360
avoid, or prevent the attack
避免或预防这种反击的途径之后

189
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,570
before resorting to deadly force if they were the ones
才能诉诸于致命武器

190
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:58,010
that provoked the secondary attack.
对抗其本人挑起的二次反击。

191
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,210
Now we'll talk about the general law of self-defense
现在我们就来讨论一下自卫法的一般条文

192
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,770
and whether it applies under the factual circumstances
及其对接下来要看到的事实情况

193
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,610
as we know them in a second.
是否适用。

194
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,430
But first I want to talk about the exception of provocation
但是首先我想先讨论一下挑衅这种情况的特例，

195
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,220
because a number of people believe
因为有很多人相信

196
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,350
that Kyle Rittenhouse provoked the attacks themselves,
Kyle Rittenhouse挑起了这些冲突从而受到攻击，

197
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,280
and therefore couldn't use the privilege of self-defense.
所以他不能进行正当防卫的辩护。

198
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,440
That by brandishing a firearm
在那样骚乱的现场，他却

199
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,860
or placing himself in this situation,
挎着一把枪晃来晃去,

200
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,010
he provoked the attack.
（很明显，）这种行为挑起了冲突。

201
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,430
Now there's three issues here.
好，这儿有三点需要说明。

202
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,850
First, is there unlawful conduct?
首先，这里有违法行为吗？

203
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,570
Did Kyle Rittenhouse engage in unlawful conduct
Kyle Rittenhouse是否存在挑起冲突的

204
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,970
that could constitute provocation
违法行为

205
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,360
and therefore prevent the defense of self-defense?
而使其无法进行自我防卫？

206
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,740
Well, Judge Schroeder granted defense motions to dismiss
嗯，Schroeder法官同意了辩方提出的撤销

207
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,990
the two misdemeanor charges against Rittenhouse.
针对Rittenhouse的两项轻罪指控的动议。

208
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,900
I think a lot of people put too much emphasis
我感觉许多人太关注

209
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,090
on those lesser included offenses.
在那些较轻的罪行上。

210
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:42,550
The charges were for possessing
（被撤销的两项指控）分别是

211
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,050
a dangerous weapon as a minor,
未成年携带致命武器

212
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:46,150
and a misdemeanor charge for breaking curfew.
以及违反宵禁这一轻罪。

213
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,790
And arguably, Wisconsin law has an exception
按理说，Wisconsin州有个例外

214
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,670
that allows miners to possess shotguns and rifles,
即允许未成年携带猎枪和步枪，

215
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,160
as long as they're not short barreled.
只要这些枪不是短桶的。

216
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,690
But more importantly, provocation requires
更重要的是，（法律上的）挑衅行为

217
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:57,420
unlawful conduct of a type likely to provoke others.
要求是会激怒他人的非法行为。

218
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,650
Now, even if those two lesser included charges had stuck,
所以，即使那两项轻罪指控保留了下来，

219
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,790
they might not have been sufficient
也不足以

220
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,900
to rise to the level of provocation.
达到“挑衅行为”的标准。

221
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,460
Mainly because Wisconsin is an open carry state.
主要因为Wisconsin州允许公开携带枪支。

222
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,450
Mere open carry of a firearm is A, not unlawful.
仅仅公开持枪，一不违法，

223
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,160
And B, possibly not the type
二也不太可能算是一种

224
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,160
likely to lead to provoking others.
挑衅他人的行为。

225
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,730
Now I'm oversimplifying here.
接下来，我就简单来说了。

226
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:17,630
This is a highly fact-specific analysis,
虽然这是高度基于特定事实的分析，

227
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,280
but it's not unreasonable that someone might not find
但是有人也会发现（公然）

228
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,870
that the gun possession, quad gun possession
持枪（或持四管枪）会激怒他人

229
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,500
didn't lead to provocation.
也不是不无道理。

230
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,700
Think about it, is it the possession of the gun
试想一下，究竟是持有枪支

231
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,000
that provokes the attack?
挑起了冲突，

232
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,640
Or is it the possession of a gun by a minor
还是未成年持枪，

233
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,740
or possession of a gun that crossed state lines
或者携枪跨越州境

234
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,470
that leads to someone provoking an attack?
引起了冲突的激化呢？

235
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,040
If you think it's the former, well, that's not illegal.
如果你认为是前者，然而那并不违法。

236
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,500
And the latter probably doesn't provoke an attack.
而后者也不太可能会挑起冲突。

237
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,150
No one says, oh, the reason I'm attacking you
没人会说，哦，我攻击你的原因是：

238
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,880
is that you're a minor with a firearm,
你是个持枪的未成年人员，

239
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,870
not that you're carrying a firearm in the first place.
而不是因为你持枪这个行为。

240
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,720
And additionally, breaking curfew
并且违反宵禁

241
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,790
probably couldn't be the requisite predicate
也不可能是挑起冲突的前提

242
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,910
because lots of people were breaking curfew
因为许多人都违反了宵禁但并没有

243
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,660
and it wasn't leading to mass provocation.
引起大规模的冲突激化。

244
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,730
Now, it's a closer call when you consider Rittenhouse
当你认为Rittenhouse

245
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,820
admitted that he pointed his gun at the victims
承认他举着枪瞄准了受害者

246
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,880
and claimed that when he was pointing his gun,
并且声称他拿枪对准他人不算是一种

247
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,770
it wasn't a dangerous provocation.
危险的挑衅，这种想法就更不太好说过去了。

248
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,900
Now you could argue that pointing your gun at someone
你也许会争论拿枪对准他人

249
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,050
is assault or misuse of a firearm,
就是一种攻击或者滥用武器，

250
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:13,450
but that probably doesn't work
但这种说法也可能说不过去，

251
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,180
if the reason that you're pointing the gun
（因为）如果拿枪对准

252
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,340
at someone in the first place
他人的最初原因

253
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,930
is for the purposes of self-defense.
是为了正当防卫。

254
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,350
And in fact, there are Wisconsin cases to this effect.
事实上，Wisconsin对此类案件是有过先例的。

255
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,440
Though, on the other other hand,
而另一方面，

256
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,060
Wisconsin courts have an interesting history
Wisconsin州法院有个有意思的先例

257
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,850
in analyzing the provocation exception.
就是对（自卫中）挑衅例外情况的分析。

258
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,050
For example, in a 1975 Wisconsin Supreme Court case,
例如一起1975年Wisconsin高等法院的案件：

259
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,020
the court held that the defendant was a provocateur
（这起案件中，）因被告公然将一把枪带回客栈

260
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,780
by virtue of openly bringing a gun into a tavern.
而被法庭认定“挑衅行为”成立。

261
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,497
The Wisconsin Supreme Court held quote,
Wisconsin高等法院的记录如下：

262
00:09:35,497 --> 00:09:37,770
"the defendant himself testified that after being slapped,
“被告本人供认在被扇了耳光之后，

263
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,590
he went out to his car, got his shotgun,
他跑到车内，取出手枪，

264
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,460
loaded it and returned to the tavern.
上了膛并返回客栈。

265
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,930
As he was entering the tavern,
在他进入客栈时，

266
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,930
he was grabbed from the side by someone
他被人从侧面抓住

267
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,690
and he pushed that person away.
并且他推开了那个人。

268
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,140
He saw Freddy Jones start toward him
他看到了Freddy Jones面向他

269
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,090
and he started shooting.
并开枪射击。

270
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,270
He stopped after four shots

271
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,450
and after Jones was out of sight.

272
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,670
The defendant requests that the court
被告方请求法院

273
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,730
grant him a new trial in the interest of justice.
为了正义而准许再次审判。

274
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,600
We find no merit to this contention.
我们发现没有这个必要

275
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,120
When the defendant left the tavern,
当被告离开了客栈，

276
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,390
got his shotgun out of the trunk,
从车中取出枪支，

277
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,190
loaded it and returned to the tavern,
上膛并返回客栈，

278
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,910
he became the provoker."
他此时成了一名挑衅者。”

279
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,270
Additionally, there is an 1883
此外，还有一起1883年

280
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,920
Wisconsin Supreme Court case that says,
Wisconsin州高等法院的案例声明：

281
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,540
quote, "if one points a loaded gun at another,
“如果一个人将一把上膛的枪对准他人，

282
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,950
and the other grapples with him to prevent the shooting
第三人与其发生扯拽并试图阻止其开枪，

283
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,810
and is shot, it is murder."
并且他还是开枪了，这就是谋杀。”

284
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,910
And this is especially important
这一点在本案Rittenhouse开枪

285
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:16,210
in the context of the Rittenhouse shooting.
的背景下尤其重要。

286
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,180
Even Rittenhouse's testimony seems to indicate
即使Rittenhouse的证词似乎表达了

287
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,050
that Rosenbaum didn't lunge at Rittenhouse
在他将枪瞄准Rosenbaum之前，Rosenbaum并

288
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,410
until he raised his gun at Rosenbaum.
没有朝他扑来。

289
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,810
And that the reason, or at least one of the reasons
而Kyle Rittenhouse射击Rosenbaum 

290
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,450
that Kyle Rittenhouse shot Rosenbaum is that he feared
的原因（至少原因之一）是他担心

291
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:30,090
that Rosenbaum would take his gun away
Rosenbaum会夺走他手里的枪

292
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,540
and use it against him.
并用来对付他。

293
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,060
And we'll talk about that in a second.
我们接下来就讨论这一点。

294
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,540
And obviously, you'd have to run a provocation analysis
很显然，本案中每处Kyle Rittenhouse开枪的地方

295
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,900
in every instance where Kyle Rittenhouse used deadly force.
都要进行挑衅分析。

296
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,510
It's not a one size fits all.
仅仅分析一次无法适用所有情形。

297
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,550
You have to look at every instance individually.
你必须单独拆开来分析每一种情形。

298
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,750
And if the jury had found that there was
如果陪审团已经发现

299
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,720
nothing unlawful that led to provocation,
无任何非法行为或者

300
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,800
or if there were illegal things going on,
即使有非法行为

301
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,430
those weren't the ones that were leading to the provocation,
但并不是引起挑衅的行为，

302
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,870
their analysis to this exception
那他们对（本案中）挑衅行为的分析

303
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,850
probably would have ended there.
也就到此为止了。

304
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,180
And they would have found that provocation didn't apply.
他们发现挑衅行为并不成立。

305
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,910
It's only where there is provocation
仅当挑衅行为存在时，

306
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,160
do we get to the next questions.
我们才需要继续分析下面的问题。

307
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,550
But, assuming that that first hurdle had been met,
但是我们假定第一步满足了，

308
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,700
you'd get to the next one, imminent danger.
那接下来你就要分析“迫在眉睫的风险”这一点了。

309
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,690
Even when someone provokes an attack,
即使一个人挑起了冲突，

310
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,930
they can regain the right to use deadly force
当他合理的认为他即将遭遇生命死亡

311
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,920
where that person reasonably believes that he
或重大人身伤害，他也可以

312
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,510
is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm.
重新具有使用致命武器的权利

313
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,010
And he may lawfully act in self-defense.
并合法的进行自卫反击。

314
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,970
Since this is essentially the same standard
由于本质上这种自卫

315
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,830
as self-defense in the first instance,
和原先的自卫有相同的标准，

316
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,400
given that the jury must have thought
鉴于陪审团一定认为

317
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,700
Kyle Rittenhouse acted in self-defense,
Kyle Rittenhouse在进行正当防卫，

318
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,450
they probably would have found that this exception
即使他们来分析这个问题，

319
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,760
to the exception, to the exception applied,
那么很可能也会发现这种例外中的例外情形

320
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,240
even if they got to this question.
也是适用的。

321
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,780
And so if they got over those two first hurdles,
所以如果他们跨过了这两道坎，

322
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,930
they then would have had to get over the third hurdle,
他们还将必须跨域第三道坎：

323
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,330
which is the duty to retreat.
逃跑义务。

324
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,450
That's the final issue in terms of
假定前两个条件都满足了，

325
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,470
whether provocation can apply,
那么是否挑衅情形成立就取决于

326
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,130
assuming the first two hurdles are met.
这最后的一个问题。

327
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,430
The third clause says that the person
这第三条款说挑起冲突的人

328
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:48,000
who provokes the attack cannot use or threaten force,
不能使用或威胁使用暴力，

329
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,700
unless he believes that he has exhausted
除非他认为他已经

330
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,240
all other opportunities to escape.
穷尽了所有其他逃生的可能。

331
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,850
If the jury got to this question,
如果陪审团真要考虑这个问题，

332
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,380
they could have felt that he had no choice
他们可能已经觉得在那样的情形下

333
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,750
under the circumstances, we don't know.
他别无选择，当然我们不知道（陪审团会怎么认为）。

334
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,590
And one of the prior issues might have precluded
并且即使考虑到这一步，

335
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,740
even getting to this question.
之前的一个问题已经被排除了。

336
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,460
But if the jury did reach this question,
但如果陪审团确实在考虑这个问题，

337
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,330
then they felt that Kyle Rittenhouse
那他们认为Kyle Rittenhouse

338
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,882
either had no opportunity to escape
要么没有机会逃跑，

339
00:12:04,882 --> 00:12:07,620
or had exhausted all of those opportunities.
要么穷尽了所有逃生的可能。

340
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,710
If that's the case, whether Wisconsin had
如果真是这样，不管Wisconsin州的法律是否有

341
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,940
a general duty to retreat might not have changed
一般意义上逃跑义务的规定也不会

342
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,460
the overall outcome here anyway.
改变本案最终的判决结果。

343
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,000
Anyone who says that this is a simple case of self-defense
有人说这就是个简单的自卫案件

344
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,780
or that it's cut and dry is definitely wrong.
或者就这么回事，这肯定是不对的。

345
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,940
But so far, we've talked about the exception
到目前为止，我们已经讨论了自卫例外中的

346
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,030
to the exception, that is provocation.
例外情形，即挑衅者的自卫权。

347
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,590
Let's now talk about whether the original exception,
下面我们讨论一下原始的例外，

348
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,560
self-defense, applied or could reasonably have applied

349
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,330
in this particular case.

350
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,960
Let's talk about the facts as we know them from the trial.
我们讨论一下法庭审判中呈现的事实。

Now, warning, these videos are graphic,

00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,070
Now this is of course,
以上基本就是案件的经过，

397
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,500
a hopefully neutral oversimplification.
希望我是客观的进行了简要描述。

398
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,320
There are a lot of other facts.
当然还有很多其他的事实。

399
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,350
But at base, this is a confusing in-charge situation,
但本质上，即使有视频脚本为证，

400
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,600
even with video footage.
这也是一种让人困惑纠结的局面。

401
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,460
And it's not an easy case in either direction.
从哪个方面来看，这也不是一起显而易见的案子。

402
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,230
So was this self-defense?
这算是正当防卫吗？

403
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,640
You can look at those facts and see a murder.
就目前呈现的事实，你可以说这是谋杀，

404
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,800
You can look at those facts and find self-defense.
你也可以看到正当防卫。

405
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,350
Two diametrically opposed beliefs
两种截然不同的结论

406
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,300
can both be reasonable at the same time.
可以同时成立。

407
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,300
There are a ton of open questions here.
这里有很多（可讨论的）开放性问题，比如：

408
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,090
Was the use of force proportionate in every encounter?
每一次对峙中使用武器都合适吗？

409
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,740
Was the use of force reasonable in every encounter?
每一次对峙中使用武器都合理吗？

410
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:40,820
Did Rittenhouse provoke any of those reactions?
那些冲突行为是由Rittenhouse激化挑起的吗？

411
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,060
But the videos and testimonies show
那些视频和证词都显示

412
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,270
a chaotic situation and people acting quickly.
在当时混乱的情形，人们也都快速反应移动，

413
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,240
Now no blanket assertions can be made.
我们无法得到确定通用的结论。

414
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,970
You have to run the self-defense analysis
你必须针对每一次开枪事件

415
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,530
for each incident individually,
单独进行正当防卫（成立与否的）分析，

416
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,130
including the shots fired at the people
包括除射向Rosenbaum, Huber和Grosskreutz

417
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,220
that weren't Rosenbaum, Huber or Grosskreutz.
之外的开枪行为。

418
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,150
With the provocation argument aside,
我们先撇开关于挑衅的争论，

419
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,950
one might look at these incidents in question
单看这些事件本身

420
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,540
and decide that they were self-defense.
来决定其是否属于正当防卫。

421
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,400
After all in the latter two incidents,
毕竟在后面的两次冲突事件中，

422
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,640
Kyle Rittenhouse was fending off
Kyle Rittenhouse躲避了

423
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,340
what was arguably an attack with a skateboard
尚存争议的来自滑板的攻击

424
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,500
and in another, the man admitted
以及当事人承认他拿着一把

425
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
he drew a gun on Rittenhouse.
枪对准了Rittenhouse。

426
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,180
But one might also reasonably conclude
但是也有人可以合理的推论出

427
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,790
that one or more of these incidents
其中一个或更多次冲突

428
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,240
were not self-defense and were therefore murder.
不是自卫而是谋杀。

429
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,570
After all, in the first incidence,
毕竟，在第一起冲突中，

430
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:16,020
Rosenbaum, an unarmed man threw a bag of clothes
并未携枪的Rosenbaum朝Rittenhouse扔

431
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,580
at Rittenhouse, which didn't land anywhere near Rittenhouse,
了一个塑料袋并且落地处都离得Rittenhouse很远，

432
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,020
after which Rittenhouse points his gun at him.
之后Rittenhouse拿着枪对准了他。

433
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,980
And then Rosenbaum moves at Rittenhouse
而Rosenbaum还是朝着Rittenhouse跑去，

434
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,720
or apparently towards the gun,
或者很明显，是朝着枪跑去，

435
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,290
and Rittenhouse shoots him four times, once in the back.
于是Rittenhouse连开四枪，其中一枪击中其背部。

436
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,280
And yes, I'm aware of Rittenhouse's
是的，我知道Rittenhouse对冲突前

437
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,540
self-serving testimony about the preceding incidents.
的证词描述是有利于自己的。

438
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,650
What I'm saying is that reasonable minds can differ.
我想说的是理性的思维可以是不同的。

439
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,020
And Rittenhouse also shoots at, but misses,
Rittenhouse同样也射击了曾半飞起

440
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,810
the unarmed jump-kick man.
踢他的无枪男，但没射中。

441
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,670
And latter incidents involving Grosskreutz and Huber
之后发生了涉及Grosskreutz和Huber的枪击事件，

442
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,590
happened perhaps a few hundred feet away
而几十辆警车也许就停在

443
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,740
from several dozen police officers.
数百英尺之外。

444
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:47,040
It's not surprising that the people who pursued Rittenhouse
追着Rittenhouse跑的人们认为是他主动开枪射击

445
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,010
thought he was an active shooter who needed to be stopped.
并应被制止的想法并不让人意外。

446
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,980
But the only question in this particular case
但是在这起特殊的案件中唯一的问题是

447
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,480
was whether Rittenhouse's actions
是否Rittenhouse的反应行为

448
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,810
could possibly have been reasonable.
可能是合理的。

449
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,750
Because remember, the standard is that
请记住，因为判定标准是

450
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,310
the jury must find that there is no reasonable doubts
陪审团必须是没有任何怀疑得认为


451
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,070
that it wasn't self-defense.
这不是正当防卫。

452
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,310
It's possible, if not probable,
也许不是十分可能，但有一定可能的是

453
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,260
that both Rittenhouse and the people he killed
Rittenhouse和被他枪杀的人


454
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,160
were simultaneously acting in self-defense.
同时都在进行正当防卫。

455
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,118
The fog of war is a real thing.
战争迷雾是真实存在的。

456
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:12,000
Reasonable beliefs can be mistaken.
（主观上）有理由的相信也可能是错的

457
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,200
The jury was accurately, based on the law,
根据法律，陪审团准确的

458
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,430
told that they had to determine
说出他们必须根据当时的形式

459
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,090
whether Rittenhouse's belief was reasonable
来决定Rittenhouse当时的认知

460
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,360
based on the circumstances.
是否合理。

461
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,870
And this reminds me of the story
说到这儿倒让我想起

462
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,060
of Gabby Giffords and Joe Zamudio.
Gabby Giffords和Joe Zamudio的案子。

463
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,960
when Giffords was shot at a political rally,
在Tucson市的一场政治集会中，当Giffords被枪击中，

464
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,270
Joe Zamudio, who was legally armed,
合法持枪的Joe Zamudio

465
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,010
came running to help when he heard the gunfire
听到枪响立马跑过来帮忙，

466
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,630
that injured Gabby Giffords and killed six others in Tucson.
此集会中的枪击事件造成Gabby Giffords受伤和6人死亡。

467
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,870
By the time that Zamudio came to the scene,
当Zamudio到达现场时，

468
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,640
unarmed civilians had already tackled
无枪的市民已经制止

469
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,370
and disarmed the perpetrator.
并剥夺了行凶者的手枪。

470
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,370
Zamudio later said that in his confusion,
Zamudio后来说当时他很迷惑，

471
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,390
he was within seconds of shooting
就在几秒之内他开枪

472
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,600
one of the people that was helping, not the shooter himself.
打中了一名见义勇为者而不是歹徒。

473
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,030
This is an issue that champions of Rittenhouse
这是Rittenhouse的支持者

474
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:46,980
should grapple with.
应该面对的问题。

475
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:49,670
If Rosenbalm or Huber or Grosskreutz
如果是Rosenbalm 或 Huber 或 Grosskreutz

476
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,430
had killed Kyle Rittenhouse, they might've been justified
杀了Kyle Rittenhouse，他们可能也会

477
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,300
in using self-defense under the law.
基于法律做正当防卫的辩护。

478
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,960
Again, reasonable minds might differ on this.
再声明一次，理性的思维在这种情况下可能是不同的。

479
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,670
But any system that incentivizes rule
任何体制的规则都是

480
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,700
by the last person standing,
由最后活着的人激励巩固，

481
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,470
that is killing the only person
那就是说把那个可能

482
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,750
who might dispute your claim of self-defense.
阻碍你声称自卫的人杀掉吧。

483
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,563
That seems well suboptimal.
这样看起来不是最地道的。

484
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,540
It's at this point, that my notes simply say,
此时此刻，我的笔记上简单的写着

485
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,453
vigilantism is bad.
义务警员制是不好的。

486
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,280
And I stand by that.
我还是坚持这一点。

487
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,580
I also worry that that is becoming a controversial position.
我也担心案子正变成有争议的局面。

488
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:20,320
Net net bringing guns to a protest is bad.
毕竟，持枪来到抗议现场是不好的。

489
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,340
Anyone that brings it, not just Kyle Rittenhouse.
我不单单说Kyle Rittenhouse，而是所有人。

490
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,680
But there's a large strain of people that simply say
还有大量的人简单认为

491
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,270
that Kyle Rittenhouse shouldn't have been there.
Kyle Rittenhouse本就不应该来这儿。

492
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,090
And that's the reason that he can't use self-defense.
这就是他不能进行自卫辩护的原因。

493
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:30,990
And by most accounts,
在大多数情况下，

494
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,600
Kyle Rittenhouse meets the definition of a vigilante.
Kyle Rittenhouse可以算是一名义务警员。

495
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,920
But whether Kyle Rittenhouse should have been there
但是Kyle Rittenhouse是否应该出现在那儿

496
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,420
in the first place isn't relevant to the questions
这一问题与他

497
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,640
of whether he legally met the definition
是否能合法的进行

498
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,320
of self-defense in the first place.
正当防卫辩护并不相关。

499
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,800
Just simply possessing a gun by itself,
仅仅持有枪支

500
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,110
doesn't prevent the application of self-defense.
也不能阻止正当防卫的成立。

501
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:50,900
And there are of course, larger social issues here as well.
当然，这里也有更大意义上的社会问题。

502
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,820
Many have claimed that it would have been impossible
许多人说如果是一个黑人

503
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,750
for a black person to kill two people,
枪杀了两个人，伤了一人

504
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,900
injured a third and fire at a fourth
并向第四人开了枪，那么他一定不可能

505
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,980
and live to walk away from the scene as Rittenhouse did,
像Rittenhouse那样被判无罪，

506
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,430
And then of course, to be found, not guilty.
并走出法庭。

507
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:05,520
And we can probably evaluate whether this is true or not.
那我们来评估一下这样说对不对。

508
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,210
One way to look at this is by studying the data
一个途径是我们来研究一下

509
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,670
on how jury's perceive self-defense.
陪审团是如何判定正当防卫方面的数据。

510
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,560
a study by John Roman found that homicides
John Roman的一份研究指出

511
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,460
with a white perpetrator and a black victim
白人杀害黑人

512
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,160
are 10 times more likely to be ruled justified
被判无罪的案件数量

513
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,700
than cases with a black perpetrator and a white victim.
是黑人杀害白人的10倍

514
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,520
And the gap is larger in states with stand your ground laws.
并且在有毫不退让法的州，这个差距更大。

515
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,940
And after accounting for a variety of confounding factors,
再算上一些混杂的因素，

516
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,130
such as whether the victim and perpetrator were strangers,
比如被害人和施害者是否认识等，

517
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,920
the gap is smaller, but still significant.
（虽然）这个差距会变小一点，但依然很大。

518
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,150
Cases with a white perpetrator and black victim
白人杀害黑人

519
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,140
are 281% more likely to be ruled justified
与黑人杀害白人相比，

520
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,900
than cases with a black perpetrator and white victim.
前者有281%的概率被判定为合法。

521
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,310
But systemic issues like that weren't on trial here.
但像这种系统性问题不会被法庭审判。

522
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,490
You don't adjudicate those kinds of systemic issues
你不会在一个单独的刑事法庭

523
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,450
in a criminal court of one individual.
上裁定那种系统性问题。

524
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:46,000
The issue is whether Kyle Rittenhouse
（法庭审判的是）Kyle Rittenhouse

525
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,290
engaged in self-defense or more specifically,
的行为是否是正当防卫，或者更确切的说，

526
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,860
whether the prosecution disproved the possibility
控方是否能证明他不具备

527
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,080
that he used self-defense.
自卫的任何可能。

528
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,520
And for what it's worth, there are lots of people
无论如何，还是有许多人

529
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,090
who think that Kyle Rittenhouse's actions
认为Kyle Rittenhouse的行为

530
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,410
were not self-defense.
不是正当防卫。

531
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,710
There are lots of other reasonable people
（同时，也）有很多理性的人

532
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,310
who think that Kyle Rittenhouse's actions were self-defense.
认为Kyle Rittenhouse的行为是正当防卫。

533
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,440
Now I doubt all of those people in both of those groups
我怀疑两方的人是否像Kenosha的陪审团那样

534
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,610
watched 100% of the trial then spent days
全程100%观看了法庭审判，

535
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,910
pouring over the jury instructions
然后花费几天的时间

536
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,420
like the Kenosha jury did.
思考发给陪审团的法律指引。

537
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,910
But the thing is, if reasonable people
问题是，如果一些理性的人

538
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,220
really could conclude that this was self-defense,
真的能得出正当防卫的结论，

539
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,420
then it means that the prosecution
那么这就意味着控方

540
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,429
didn't prove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.
未能毫无置疑的证明这不是正当防卫。

541
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:22,300
That's the definition of reasonable doubt.
这算是合理怀疑的含义。

542
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,250
Now that being said, an acquittal doesn't mean
话虽如此，Kyle Rittenhouse未被定罪但并不意味着

543
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,070
that Kyle Rittenhouse didn't do it.
他没有做这件事。

544
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,110
It doesn't mean that what Kyle Rittenhouse did was right.
（同时，）也并不意味着Kyle Rittenhouse这样做就是对的。

545
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,614
And the pathology of Kyle Rittenhouse's
而关于Kyle Rittenhouse圣徒言行的

546
00:19:31,614 --> 00:19:33,620
hagiography is another issue entirely.
反常完全是另外一个问题了。

547
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,460
And it certainly doesn't mean that he did nothing wrong.
当然，这也并不意味着他什么都没做错。

548
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,403
It just means the jury didn't think
只能说明陪审团并不认为

549
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:39,250
that the prosecution proved self-defense
控方毫无置疑的证明了

550
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,310
beyond a reasonable doubt.
正当防卫不成立。

551
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,940
And while you can't necessarily infer it
尽管你不一定能从陪审团的决定

552
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,040
from the jury's decision, it might be the case
推断出上面的结论，但这可以说明

553
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,570
that Kyle Rittenhouse did nothing legally wrong.
在法律上Kyle Rittenhouse并没有做错什么。

554
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,600
But under the most favorable interpretations of the facts,
但是对事实做最有利的解释，

555
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,980
Kyle Rittenhouse brought gasoline to a match party
Kyle Rittenhouse带着汽油去参加火柴派对

556
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,650
and people are now dead as a result.
结果是人全死了。

557
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,150
He made a bad situation worse.
他的行为使不好的的情形变的更糟。

558
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,250
And let's face it, if someone uses non-deadly force
就事实来说，如果有人使用非致命武器

559
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,900
against you while you are carrying a gun,
挑衅身上带枪的你，

560
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,730
it's more likely to turn deadly.
结果是很可能对方丧命。

561
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,250
Rosenbaum, jump-kick man and arguably, Huber,
Rosenbaum, jump-kick man和有些争议的Huber

562
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,290
used non-deadly force,
使用的是非致命武器,

563
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,650
which would not in the abstract
理论上这种武器让人有理由相信

564
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,910
trigger a reasonable belief of imminent harm,
不会带来立即的伤害，

565
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,270
which is not to say that unarmed people
当然，这也不是说没带武器的人

566
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,330
can't exercise deadly force or create a reasonable belief
就不能致人死地或者造成明显的

567
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,260
of eminent, deadly harm,they absolutely can.
致命伤害，他们绝对可以。

568
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,570
Indeed, it appears that the jury
事实上看起来陪审团

569
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:19,550
believed Rittenhouse's testimony
采信了Rittenhouse的证词：

570
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,290
that they were going for his gun
他们看准了他的枪，

571
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,940
or grabbed his gun in an attempt to take his gun
或者要抓住他的枪夺过来

572
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,520
and use it against him.
并对付他。

573
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,630
And in a huge stretch, in Rittenhouse's speculation,
并且就Rittenhouse的更广泛的推测而言，

574
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:31,470
take his gun and use it against others.
他们夺了他的枪之后还会危及其他人。

575
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,140
Now, those arguing that, but for Kyle Rittenhouse,
那些认为要不是Kyle Rittenhouse

576
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,250
being present with his gun,
带着枪来

577
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,590
these shootings wouldn't have happened are right.
枪击也不会发生的想法是对的。

578
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,350
However, but for causation,
然而，这种“要不是”的因果问题，

579
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,850
or what we call sine qua non causation,
或者我们称其为必要条件，

580
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,440
it doesn't rise to the level of guilt
根本达不到“毫无置疑”

581
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,660
beyond a reasonable doubt.
判其有罪的水平。

582
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,780
It's necessary for a conviction, but it's not sufficient.
这对犯罪行为是必要的，但不是充分的。

583
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,597
Now I've seen lots of people say, quote,
我看到过很多人说：

584
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:52,490
"the jury reached the right verdict."
“陪审团作出了正确的裁决。”

585
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,930
Now there is a strong version
对于这个表述有一个强版本

586
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,530
and a weak version of that statement.
和弱版本。

587
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,620
The weak version is that the jury was correct
弱版本是说陪审团对Kyle Rittenhouse

588
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,190
to find that there was reasonable doubt
不是正当防卫的论点

589
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,830
that Kyle Rittenhouse didn't use self-defense.
持有一些合理的怀疑。

590
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,800
However, the strong version is that the jury
而强版本则说陪审团

591
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,450
proactively found him innocent or even a hero.
毫无怀疑的认定他是无辜的，甚至是一名英雄。

592
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,290
But assuming we're going with the weak version,
设想我们采用弱版本的说法，

593
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,070
it's entirely possible that the jury verdict
那么陪审团完全可能是

594
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,360
accurately reflects the law of Wisconsin.
准确的遵照Wisconsin州的法律作出的裁决。

595
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,550
I've never seen a politician run on a platform
我从来没见过一个政客

596
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,050
of installing a duty to retreat in the law.
要给法律加上逃跑义务。

597
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,580
If Wisconsin had a duty to retreat,
如果Wisconsin规定了逃跑义务，

598
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,430
the outcome of this case,
那么此案的结果

599
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,800
very well might've been different.
非常有可能就不一样了。

600
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,210
Stated differently, if this had occurred in Massachusetts,
换句话说，如果此案发生在Massachusetts州，

601
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,090
the law could have militated a different result.
该州的法律可能产生不同的结果。

602
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,270
Though, admittedly, maybe reasonable minds
然而还是得承认，到时理性的人们

603
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,570
might differ on that as well.
对此案也会产生分歧。

604
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,250
Maybe Kyle Rittenhouse retreated
也许Kyle Rittenhouse穷尽了

605
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,970
at every possible opportunity.
所有可能逃生的机会。

606
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,850
But I will leave it to you and by proxy, your politicians,
那这（添加逃跑义务）究竟是好还是坏，我就

607
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:37,560
as to whether that is a good thing or a bad thing.
留给你和代理你的政客决定吧。

608
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,030
Though, I'll point out that for those
然而，我要指出对于那些

609
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,260
that are happy that Kyle Rittenhouse was found not guilty,
乐见Kyle Rittenhouse无罪的人，

610
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,200
they should recognize that logically,
他们应该意识到，逻辑上讲，

611
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,340
they should also be in favor of an alternate reality
他们也乐见另外一种事实的发生：

612
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,570
where Gaige Grosskreutz shot and killed Kyle Rittenhouse.
Gaige Grosskreutz用枪射杀了Kyle Rittenhouse。

613
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,403
And remember, if you think that
记住，如果你认为

614
00:21:49,403 --> 00:21:51,330
Rosenbaum, Huber or Grosskreutz
Rosenbaum, Huber或者Grosskreutz

615
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,716
all provoked a response from Kyle Rittenhouse,
挑衅了Kyle Rittenhouse而致使

616
00:21:53,716 --> 00:21:55,200
Rittenhouse's use of deadly force
Rittenhouse使用了致命武器，

617
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,380
probably gave them the right to use deadly force right back
那么在相同的法律下，这也给了他们三人使用

618
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,610
under the same laws.
致命武器回击的权利。

619
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,300
Under current Wisconsin law, if Kyle Rittenhouse
在Wisconsin当前的法律下，如果Kyle Rittenhouse

620
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,330
is not guilty, by reason of self-defense,
因为正当防卫无罪，

621
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,640
Gaige Grosskreutz would also have been not guilty
那么若是Gaige Grosskreutz枪杀了Kyle Rittenhouse，

622
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,490
if he had shot and killed Kyle Rittenhouse.
那他也可能会是无罪的。

623
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,820
And keep in mind that in this scenario,
记住在这种情况下，

624
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,334
Kyle Rittenhouse is dead and it would have been
Kyle Rittenhouse死了，

625
00:22:13,334 --> 00:22:15,310
Grosskreutz setting the narrative.
是Grosskreutz在陈述这件事。

626
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,120
And to the extent that you think Grosskreutz
你可以想象到Grosskreutz

627
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,190
would have crafted his testimony to support
会精心遣造他的证词来支持

628
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,630
an argument of self-defense.
他做正当防卫的辩护。

629
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,880
Then consider that Kyle Rittenhouse probably crafted
而现在是Kyle Rittenhouse，同样的，他很可能

630
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,730
his story in exactly the same way.
也好好准备了他的叙事。

631
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,130
So the ultimate takeaway here
所以最终的要点是

632
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,620
is that these incidents are murky at best.
这些冲突事件充其量都是模糊不清的。

633
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,640
Occurred in a jurisdiction with very broad
在一个有着非常宽泛的

634
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,700
self-defense and firearm laws，
自卫和携枪法律的州，

635
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,130
the prosecution had a very high standard to meet.
控方（要想胜诉）是要满足很高标准的。

636
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,860
And while we didn't cover it in this video,
虽然我在本视频中没有提到，

637
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,930
the defendant put on a very good defense.
但（其实）辩方的表现也非常出色。

638
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,980
The rest I will leave to you.
（好，）其余的分析我就留给你了。

639
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,720
Now, if you'd like to watch something legal,
现在如果你喜欢看一下法律的东西，

640
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,150
that's much more lighthearted,
并且要更轻松一些的，

641
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,600
I'd recommend my mini documentary, "Bad Law Words Good"
那我推荐我的迷你纪录片, “法劣词良”，

642
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,700
where I explore all of the most common legal
在这些记录片中，我会探索所有最常见的法律

643
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,480
and linguistic comments that people throw around
和语言评论，这些评论都是人们在日常生活中

644
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,430
in everyday life incorrectly.
到处用且用的不对。

645
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,260
It is a hilarious and educational romp
（视频中，我会）通过法律误解，

646
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,480
through legal misunderstandings, logical fallacies,
逻辑缺陷以及法律与秩序的荒诞事件，

647
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,260
and law and order parodies.
以一种既幽默又教育的方式呈现。

648
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,310
And it's only on Nebula, which you can get for free
我的纪录片独家发布在Nebula上，你可以

649
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,730

通过Curiosity Stream免费观看。

650
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,370
Because Nebula is where I release all my videos early,
Nebula是我最先发布视频的地方，

651
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,830
usually with extended cuts and where I can experiment
通常我也会发布一些额外的剪辑，并且我还会做


652
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,320
with content and put things that I couldn't put on YouTube.
内容方面的实验和发布一些我无法发布到油管上的东西。

653
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,160
And we're thrilled to be partnering with today's sponsor
今天，我们非常开心能与Curiosity Stream赞助商
