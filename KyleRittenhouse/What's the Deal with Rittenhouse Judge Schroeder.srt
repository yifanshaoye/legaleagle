00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:02,350
If you were following the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse on social media,
如果您在社交媒体上持续追踪Kyle Rittenhouse案的审判，

3
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,150
you might've come to the conclusion:
你可能得出如下的结论：

4
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,570
that Judge Schroeder was a hopelessly biased nutcase
Schroeder法官是一个无可救药的偏袒狂，

5
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,310
who was making up all the rules to help Kyle Rittenhouse.
他编造的所有规则都是在帮助Kyle Rittenhouse。

7
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,590
Was he?
是这样吗？

8
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:13,473
(gentle music)
（轻音乐）

9
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,530
Now most of the situations that people are objecting to
如今人们反对的大多数情形

10
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,180
involve the application of the rules of evidence.
涉及到证据（能否被呈上法庭）相关规则的适用。

12
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,910
In state court, the judg has broad discretion
在州法庭上，法官有着很宽泛的自主裁量权：

13
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,980
to make rulings on the admissibility of evidence
他能指定规则允许哪些证据被呈上法庭，

14
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,110
and how to run their courtroom.
以及庭审该如何进行。

15
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,500
This includes things like which witnesses are allowed to testify,
这还包括允许哪些证人出庭作证，

17
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,260
what the lawyers are allowed to ask, what topics are off limits,
律师能问什么样的问题，提到哪些话题超出案件范围，

19
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,040
and a whole bunch of other things.
以及一大推其他的事情。

20
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,980
And there were a few
incidents that stuck out.

21
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,330
So let's talk about incident number one,

22
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,750
where Judge Schroeder ruled

23
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,920
that the prosecution
could not call the people

24
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,500
that Kyle Rittenhouse
shot and killed victims.

25
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,590
The defense attorneys argue

26
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
that using the word victim

27
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,010
could prejudice the jury
against Rittenhouse.

28
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,180
Judge Schroeder said, "The word victim

29
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
is a loaded, loaded word."

30
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,470
When the judge ruled in
favor of the defendant,

31
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,530
critics jumped to the conclusion

32
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,760
that Judge Schroeder was showing

33
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,940
inappropriate favoritism to Rittenhouse.

34
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,090
Now trial judges have lots of discretion.

35
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,360
The Wisconsin rules of evidence

36
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,700
mostly track the federal
rules of evidence.

37
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,470
Even if particular evidence
isn't explicitly ruled out,

38
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,810
judges have lots of leeway.

39
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Wisconsin rule of evidence 904.03,

40
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,860
which is very similar

41
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
to federal rule of evidence 403 states,

42
00:01:14,397 --> 00:01:15,397
"Although relevant,
evidence may be excluded

43
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,240
if its probative value is
substantially outweighed

44
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
by the danger of unfair prejudice,

45
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:20,890
confusion of the issues,
or misleading the jury,

46
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
or by considerations of undue delay,

47
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,810
waste of time, or needless presentation

48
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
of cumulative evidence."

49
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:27,810
In other words, evidence
might be minimally relevant,

50
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
but if the risk of prejudice is too great,

51
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,610
you shouldn't allow that
evidence into the courtroom.

52
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,130
And the way that the victim
is used in a courtroom

53
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,520
is different than what's used
outside of the courthouse.

54
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,640
Rittenhouse claimed that he
was acting in self-defense.

55
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
If he was right, the three men

56
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,450
would not be considered victims

57
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,770
in the legal sense of the word.

58
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,940
They would be assailants
who attacked Rittenhouse.

59
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,150
People also suggested that Judge Schroeder

60
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,930
was making a special rules
just for Rittenhouse,

61
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,960
but the judge's ruling was consistent

62
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,730
with the way that he
handles criminal trials.

63
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,530
According to the Kenosha News,

64
00:01:56,327 --> 00:01:57,327
"that is Schroeder standard practice

65
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,980
in criminal cases and is not unique

66
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,490
to this handling of the Rittenhouse case."

67
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,540
Criminal lawyers said these rulings

68
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,270
were commonplace in their
jurisdictions as well.

69
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,310
Victims suggest guilt before it is proven

70
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
and prosecuting and
convicting someone is hard,

71
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,480
as well it should be.

72
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,010
And of course, it's always okay to refer

73
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,870
to these people by their names,

74
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,170
which tactically can be even better

75
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,660
because it humanizes them.

76
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,830
In a court of law, a criminal defendant

77
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,300
must be given his full due process rights.

78
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,540
The whole object of a fair trial

79
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,900
is not to prejudge the defendant.

80
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:25,850
That means judges should
be skeptical of evidence

81
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,437
that a jury could use to
infer someone's guilt,

82
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
if that evidence is not truly
probative of what happened.

83
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
And that brings us to the second incidence

84
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,470
where Judge Schroeder ruled

85
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,380
that the three men who were shot

86
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,950
could be referred to as
rioters, looters, and arsonists.

87
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,550
Well, specifically what
Judge Schroeder said

88
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,200
was let the evidence show
what the evidence shows,

89
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,210
that any or one of these people

90
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,270
were engaged in arson,
rioting, or looting,

91
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,370
that I'm not going to tell the defense

92
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,900
they can't call them that.

93
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,190
Prosecutor Thomas Binger said

94
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,310
that this was a double standard.

95
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:52,537
"I think it's the exact same issue.

96
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,900
The terms that I'm identifying here,

97
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
such as rioters, looters, arsonists,

98
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,120
are as loaded, if not more
loaded, than the term victim."

99
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,620
First, a defendant
generally gets to put on

100
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,920
whatever defense they want.

101
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,220
So a court should err on the side

102
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,390
of allowing a defendant to do something

103
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,200
and get more freedom than the prosecution.

104
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,030
But second of all, Judge
Schroeder did not rule

105
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,030
that the defense could
absolutely call them

106
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:13,950
rioters and looters.

107
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,910
He ruled that if the defense could prove

108
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,850
that the three men were
rioting and looting,

109
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,350
then they could use those terms

110
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,630
during the closing argument.

111
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,930
And the judge prohibited the defense

112
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,340
from using those terms during
their opening statement,

113
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,640
very similar to the ruling he
made about the word victim.

114
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,210
Neither side could use those terms

115
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
unless they prove their case.

116
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,100
That takes us to incident number three,

117
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,690
where Judge Schroeder dressed down

118
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,470
the prosecutor saying,

119
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,447
"Don't get brazen with me!"

120
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,570
Judge Schroeder was again accused of bias

121
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,460
when he blew up at
Prosecutor Thomas Binger.

122
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,300
First of all, yes,
judges do yell at lawyers

123
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,010
and sometimes those lawyers deserve it.

124
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,380
Some do it more frequently than others.

125
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,980
And Kenosha lawyers say that Schroeder

126
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
is definitely a yeller.

127
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,300
Now second, the judge sent
the jury out of the room

128
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,440
before admonishing the prosecutor.

129
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,900
And third, and most importantly,

130
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
we should look to what caused
Schroeder to blow his top.

131
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
When Rittenhouse took to the stand

132
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
to testify in his own defense,

133
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,710
the prosecutor seemed to refer

134
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,980
to Rittenhouse's prior
silence about what happened.

135
00:04:04,657 --> 00:04:05,657
"Since August 25th, 2020,

136
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
this is the first time that
you have told your story."

137
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,580
That's what the prosecutor
asked on the stand.

138
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,640
The defense immediately objected

139
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,910
and Schroeder sustained the objection,

140
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,450
disallowing the question.

141
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,650
And there's good reason for that.

142
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,840
In criminal cases, the
5th Amendment protects

143
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,010
against self-incrimination,
among other things.

144
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,460
This means that a defendant's
decision not to talk

145
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,650
can't be used against them.

146
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,630
The judge sustained the objection

147
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,950
because Binger's question
was too close to the line.

148
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,560
But then Binger basically asked

149
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,920
the same question a different way.

150
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:33,670
He referred to the many months of people

151
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,050
talking about the case and said,

152
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:36,527
"After all of that now,

153
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,620
you are telling us your
side of the story, correct?"

154
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,350
It seems that what Binger was getting at

155
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,900
was that because Rittenhouse
hadn't testified before

156
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,670
and was now testifying after everyone else

157
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,260
had taken the stand, and
after all of the evidence

158
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
had come out, that Rittenhouse was now

159
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,540
in a position where he
could change his story

160
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,410
and craft it to be consistent

161
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:54,690
with everyone else's testimony.

162
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,470
But, of course, a question
can be two things at once.

163
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,700
And if it's too prejudicial,

164
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,150
even if there is some
probative value to it,

165
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,380
well, then the court
can still disallow it,

166
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
which the court specifically had done it.

167
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
Schroeder had disallowed it.

168
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,840
So Judge Schroeder asked
to the jury be removed

169
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,250
so that he could basically
just yell at Binger.

170
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,910
- You need to account for this.

171
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,340
The problem is, this is a
grave constitutional violation

172
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
for you to talk about
the defendant's silence.

173
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
And that is, and you're right,

174
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,350
you're right on the borderline.

175
00:05:32,473 --> 00:05:33,473
And you may be over.

176
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
But it better stop.

177
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,370
- In other words, it doesn't matter

178
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,590
whether you think
Rittenhouse was guilty or not

179
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
in the context of a criminal trial,

180
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,860
his post-arrest silence
couldn't be used against him.

181
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,360
Binger said he understood,

182
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,370
but then to add insult to injury,

183
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,210
he then plunged into a series of questions

184
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
about a matter the judge
had already previously ruled

185
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,100
was off limits,

186
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
a video where Rittenhouse fantasized

187
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,060
about shooting alleged shoplifters,

188
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,250
which takes us incident number four.

189
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,060
The judge ruled that the prosecution

190
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,330
could not show a video
showing Rittenhouse saying

191
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:02,310
that he wished he could shoot two people

192
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,180
leaving a CVS store.

193
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,550
Now the background is that before trial,

194
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,190
the prosecution moved
to introduce evidence

195
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,060
of a video where Rittenhouse says

196
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,450
he wished he could shoot two people

197
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,060
who were suspected shoplifters.

198
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
The prosecutor said the video was relevant

199
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,420
to Rittenhouse's state of mind and motive.

200
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,070
He said, Rittenhouse was
"essentially a teenage vigilante

201
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
involving himself in things
that don't concern him."

202
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,640
Now the judge excluded the video

203
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,270
on the grounds that the video

204
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,190
wasn't made before the riots.

205
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,630
It was recorded two weeks earlier.

206
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
And the judge felt that in another video,

207
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,780
which allegedly showed
Rittenhouse assaulting a girl

208
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:31,810
who was in a fight with her sister

209
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
was also not relevant
to what Rittenhouse did

210
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
on August 20th, 2020 in Kenosha.

211
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
The video suggested Rittenhouse

212
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,940
had a propensity for violence,

213
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,210
but neither video had anything
to do with the protest.

214
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,750
Now it's important to note that judges

215
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,270
are arbiters and are supposed to protect

216
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,050
the rights of a criminal defendant.

217
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,350
And certainly, these videos
make Rittenhouse look bad,

218
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,510
but we aren't supposed to
convict people for looking bad.

219
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
The judge was limiting the evidence

220
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,620
so that the only evidence the jury heard

221
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,060
had to do with what actually
happened on August 20th

222
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
when Rittenhouse
encountered the three men.

223
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,260
Now crim law 101 is that you can't,

224
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,100
or at least generally you can't

225
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,300
because there are always exceptions,

226
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,450
you can't use propensity evidence

227
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
to show someone committed
a crime on a specific day.

228
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,670
You can show that they
committed the crime at issue,

229
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,980
but you're not allowed to convict them

230
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,360
because they had a certain
propensity towards crime.

231
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
Generally speaking, a criminal defendant

232
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,530
can be convicted just
because they have a history

233
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
of doing bad things.

234
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
The state still has to prove

235
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,630
that they committed the crimes

236
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,690
they were charged with.

237
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,750
And so when Judge Schroeder yelled,

238
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:27,567
"Don't get brazen with me,"

239
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,910
it was the culmination of two mistakes

240
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,460
by the prosecutor
referring to Rittenhouse's

241
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,260
post-arrest silence,
after being told not to,

242
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,630
and referring to the CVS videotape,

243
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
despite being told not to.

244
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Binger felt that the
defense had opened the door

245
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,850
and it was now okay to go
into that subject area.

246
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,150
But even if that were the case,

247
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,830
you still need to get permission

248
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,050
from the judge or face their wrath.

249
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,100
And Binger still had a
hard time letting it go.

250
00:07:48,787 --> 00:07:49,787
"This was the subject of emotion,

251
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,420
I'm well aware of that.

252
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
And the court left the door open."

253
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,390
But Judge Schroeder screamed,
"For me, not for you."

254
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,660
You should have come and
asked for reconsideration.

255
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
All trial lawyers know that if you appear

256
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:01,890
to disregard a judge's order,

257
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,430
you're probably going to get it.

258
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,840
And to the judge's credit,

259
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,950
well, we all got to see Schroeder

260
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,280
lambaste the prosecutors on the live feed.

261
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,130
The jury was sequestered away

262
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,490
and would have been completely unaware.

263
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
So it wouldn't have prejudiced
the prosecution's case.

264
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,110
That takes us to incident number five.

265
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,720
Judge Schroeder allowed Rittenhouse

266
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,010
to pick his own jurors?

267
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,490
Well, not exactly.

268
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:21,810
Judge Schroeder had
Rittenhouse blindly pick

269
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
the 12 jurors who would be
deciding his case out of a hat.

270
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,200
It's weird, but in
Wisconsin and other states,

271
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,350
the courts regularly seat more jurors

272
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,010
than necessary because
at the end of trials,

273
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,980
it's common for jurors to
be stricken from the panel

274
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,380
for various reasons.

275
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,340
This could be a for misconduct

276
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,580
or a juror having a family emergency

277
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,610
or just getting sick.

278
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,670
And the Rittenhouse trial,
18 perspective jurors

279
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
heard all the evidence.

280
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
After closing arguments,

281
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,050
the judge told Rittenhouse
to randomly pick

282
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
six numbers out of a tumbler.

283
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Those six numbers were
stricken from the panel.

284
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
The 12 who were left were his jury.

285
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,210
Whittling down the jurors is not unusual.

286
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,900
Picking them out of a
hat is somewhat unusual.

287
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,860
Judge Schroeder said he'd have defendants

288
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,800
do the selection for years.

289
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,170
He said that responding to critics,

290
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
he started doing it after a case

291
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,820
where there was only one
perspective black juror.

292
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,470
That person was eliminated from the jury

293
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
when the clerk picked that juror's name

294
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,300
out of the panel.

295
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,240
That resulted in a black defendant

296
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,770
being tried by an all white jury

297
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,020
as a result of one of
the court administrators.

298
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,460
Judge Schroeder felt
that that was not ideal.

299
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,970
He said, "It was a bad optic, I thought.

300
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,930
I think people feel better
when they have control.

301
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,350
So ever since that case,

302
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:30,930
I have had an almost universal policy

303
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,640
of having the defendant do the picks.

304
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,550
When only one part of Judge
Schroeder's explanation

305
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,180
was cherry picked and then
circulated among social media,

306
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,030
it looked terrible.

307
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,690
But actually it seems like his explanation

308
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,940
makes perfect sense.

309
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:45,470
While this process is a
little bit theatrical,

310
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,090
the reasons for doing so
actually empower the defendants.

311
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,690
And it's hard to imagine that
there would be any prejudice

312
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
to either the defense or the prosecution

313
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,190
as a result of this particular foible.

314
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,470
That takes us to incident number six.

315
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,380
The judge disallowed
zooming in on a video.

316
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Well, not exactly.

317
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,870
Judge Schroeder was mocked for sustaining

318
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,640
a defense objection to zooming in

319
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,120
on video footage via in iPad.

320
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,070
This was presented as
either a nefarious plot

321
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,150
between the defense lawyers and the judge,

322
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,510
or is evidence that the judge
was old and out of touch.

323
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,180
Now it's not that the judge said

324
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:18,610
that they couldn't zoom in at all.

325
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,940
The judge just ruled that the prosecution

326
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,420
could zoom in on images

327
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,670
as long as they had an expert testify

328
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,250
as to how the pinch and zoom
worked on an Apple device,

329
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
to make sure that that process

330
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,330
wasn't adulterating the evidence.

331
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,570
Now, the prosecution
couldn't produce an expert

332
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,590
on short notice so the jury
wound up seeing the video

333
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,230
on a Windows machine hooked up to a TV.

334
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,410
Now this was kind of a
ticky-tacky objection

335
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,410
by the defense, but in fairness,

336
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,850
lawyers are required to
authenticate an item of evidence.

337
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And this applies to every piece
of evidence it's introduced,

338
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,130
including government records,

339
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,280
business records, photographs,
video, audio, you name it.

340
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,010
But look, the prosecution
has the burden of proof.

341
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,330
So it's on them to make sure

342
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
that what they're doing,
if they are changing

343
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,760
the evidence in any way,

344
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,450
isn't adulterating the
underlying evidence.

345
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,550
And of course, there was also an issue

346
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,470
with drone footage
where a file was smaller

347
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,020
than it should have been.

348
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
And that takes us to the next incident

349
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,240
where the judge apparently asked the jury

350
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
to applaud for a defense witness.

351
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,570
Well, sort of.

352
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,580
This one is interesting.

353
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
On Veteran's Day, Judge
Schroeder decided to recognize

354
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
anyone in the courtroom who
had served in the armed forces.

355
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:23,267
"I just want to observe
that it's Veterans Day,

356
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,090
and any veterans in the room?

357
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,470
On the jury or anywhere else?"

358
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,250
When no one responded, the judge said,

359
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:29,837
"Well, that's unusual not to
have at least someone in here,

360
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,270
but Dr. Black is, what branch?"

361
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,010
He was referring to the
defense witness, John Black,

362
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,250
who was about to take the stand.

363
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
Black is a use of force expert

364
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,730
who told the judge that
he had served in the army.

365
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,890
The judge then said,

366
00:11:42,723 --> 00:11:43,723
"Okay, I think we can
have a round of applause

367
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
to the people who have
served our country."

368
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
The entire courtroom applauded,

369
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
including members of the jury.

370
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
This one was just sloppy
and completely unnecessary.

371
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,750
It seemed have the unintended effect

372
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:55,850
of bolstering the reputation of Dr. Black

373
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,220
before he took the stand,

374
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,450
who happened to be a defense witness,

375
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,350
but it was just completely unnecessary

376
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:02,890
to run that risk for a
little grand standing

377
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,310
in this particular case.

378
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
And then there were accusations

379
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,670
that Judge Schroeder was
just unusually chummy

380
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,680
with Rittenhouse and wanted
to see him acquitted.

381
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,320
For example, there's
a picture of the judge

382
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,540
and Rittenhouse being very close together

383
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,450
as they're watching a video.

384
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,140
But equally likely is that Schroeder

385
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:21,570
was just a relatively pro defendant judge.

386
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
And of course there's a wide disparity

387
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
between criminal defendants
who are remanded to custody

388
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,230
and those who are out on
their own recognizance.

389
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,620
Rittenhouse was able to
attend, not in shackles,

390
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,150
not going back to prison and in a suit.

391
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,090
We don't wanna make things
too easy on the prosecutor.

392
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,090
And maybe the answer here
is that criminal defendants

393
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
more often should get
the benefit of the doubt

394
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
like Rittenhouse did.

395
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,070
But more pragmatically,
if a judge doesn't err

396
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,270
on the side of the defense,

397
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,670
they are likely to see an appeal

398
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,110
and no trial judge wants
to, A, get reversed

399
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:54,670
by the court of appeals, and
B, have to retry a defendant.

400
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,020
And that's one reason why
they might err on the side

401
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,900
of disallowing evidence
that might otherwise come in

402
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,490
to make sure that there aren't other

403
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
constitutional violations.

404
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,620
And for better or worse,

405
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,453
Schroeder was clearly paying attention

406
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:09,910
to how the trial was covered.

407
00:13:11,017 --> 00:13:12,017
"When I talked about
problems with the media,

408
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,650
when this trial started,

409
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,020
we're there in part, not fully,

410
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
but in part, because of
grossly irresponsible handling

411
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,860
of what comes out of this trial.

412
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,120
I will tell you this,

413
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,190
I'm going to think long and hard

414
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,410
about live television of
a trial again, next time."

415
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:25,047
"I don't know, I've always
been a firm believer in it

416
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,710
because I think the people
should be able to see

417
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,340
what's going on, but what I see,

418
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,090
what's being done is
really quite frightening.

419
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,300
Frightening, that's
the right word for it."

420
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,030
Now I can't imagine how he
possibly got that impression,

421
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,820
which takes us to the final incidents.

422
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,560
Schroeder had a racist
cell phone ringtone.

423
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,410
Come on, people.

424
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,620
A cell phone ringtone, really?

425
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Come on, you're better than this.

426
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,900
But also, Judge Schroeder, dude,

427
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
turn your cell phone off in court.

428
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,610
That is rule number one.

429
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,060
Now there is no doubt that Schroeder

430
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
is a crotchety old man,

431
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,050
but maybe that's just
because his cell phone plan

432
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,230
is too expensive.

433
00:13:59,063 --> 00:14:00,063
He's getting calls all the time,

434
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,180
even when he's in court.

435
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,360
He could have saved a ton of money

436
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,550
by switching to today's
sponsor Ting Mobile.

437
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,650
In fact, I personally
switched to Ting Mobile

438
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,460
and save literally hundreds
of dollars a month.

439
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
I'm not kidding.

440
00:14:09,273 --> 00:14:10,273
Why?

441
00:14:10,106 --> 00:14:11,106
Well, because of this.

442
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:11,939
Yes, that is a real cell phone bill

443
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,090
that I got with my previous provider.

444
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
And that's why I personally
switched to Ting.

445
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,460
And Ting Mobile has three brand new plans

446
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
to make sure that never happens again.

447
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,850
And all the Ting's plans
have unlimited talk and text

448
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,170
starting at just $10 per month.

449
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,520
So you can use the flex plan

450
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,930
and only pay for what you use,

451
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,600
which is especially great

452
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:27,433
if you're around wifi all day,

453
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,670
but you can also choose a
set of 12 gigabytes of data

454
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,390
for $35 or get a full
unlimited plan for $45 a month.

455
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,330
Switching plans is really easy

456
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,850
because you can keep
your same phone number

457
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,460
and use pretty much any phone.

458
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,020
And the service is great too

459
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,250
because Ting partners with
several massive networks,

460
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,510
probably the very same one

461
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,870
that you're using right now

462
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,880
but at a huge discount.

463
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,220
They literally use the
same infrastructure.

464
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,110
Now I actually can't tell you which ones,

465
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,070
because I always respect contracts,

466
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
but let's just say that my
service hasn't changed at all.

467
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,940
And Ting still gives you the option

468
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,270
to just pay for what you
use with their flex plan.

469
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,170
Now they just give you the possibility

470
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,730
of an unlimited plan as well.

471
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
So if you want unlimited,

472
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,690
you can go absolutely crazy.

473
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,310
And it's incredibly
easy to transfer service

474
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,900
just by simply ordering a Ting SIM card,

475
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:08,810
popping it in and setting it up.

476
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,360
No phone calls even required.

477
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,920
But if you do wanna talk to Ting,

478
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
since they don't have
brick and mortar stores,

479
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,570
you can call them up and immediately talk

480
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,890
to real human beings or chat
via instant message or Discord.

481
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,610
You'll talk to real human
beings, not AI robots.

482
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
So if you'd like to give Ting a try,

483
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,690
Legal Eagles will get a
free $25 service credit

484
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
